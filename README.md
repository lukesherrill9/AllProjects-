•	Business Simulator: Led an 8-week group project simulating a computer startup, rotating through roles in management, manufacturing, advertising, and strategy. Presented the final deliverable to a panel of four McIntire alumni who work in Finance & Venture Capital.
We prioritized R&D investments early, ensuring product differentiation and long-term market competitiveness. Manufacturing decisions were driven by demand forecasting, allowing us to scale production efficiently while minimizing excess inventory costs. We timed loan acquisitions strategically, leveraging debt to fund expansion while maintaining financial stability. By reinvesting profits into product development and marketing, we increased brand equity and customer retention. 
We strategically chose to produce in LATAM, leveraging its lower manufacturing costs and proximity to key markets, which allowed us to maximize profitability, scale production efficiently, and meet rising demand without excessive overhead.

•	Data Management Project: Designed and executed SQL queries to optimize WNBA viewership data storage and retrieval 
Created a structured SQL database to analyze WNBA viewership and advertisement effectiveness, designing entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to define key relationships between viewers, games, advertisements, and teams. We executed complex SQL queries to extract insights on demographic trends, team popularity, ad performance, and seasonal viewership patterns. Our ad viewership tracking involved joining tables linking game airtime, ad placements, and viewer interactions, allowing us to measure unique viewer counts per advertisement. Additionally, we conducted seasonal viewership analysis, identifying peak engagement periods to optimize scheduling and marketing strategies. While our project relied on synthetic data, we proposed integrating real-time APIs and player statistics to enhance predictive modeling. Ultimately, this project showcased my SQL expertise, critical thinking, and ability to develop data-driven strategies to boost engagement, sponsorship revenue, and business intelligence in sports analytics.
•	Customer Analytics Project: Developed multiple regression models, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and created visualizations using ggplot2 and regression trees in R Studio for a furniture store’s dataset.
For my customer analytics project, I used R Studio to analyze a furniture store’s dataset, applying multiple regression models, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations with ggplot2 and regression trees. I examined factors like price, promotions, and customer demographics to understand their impact on sales. Through EDA, I identified key trends, cleaned data, and built predictive models to support pricing and marketing decisions. This project reinforced the importance of regression in forecasting and business strategy, improving my ability to interpret results, assess model accuracy, and communicate insights effectively through data visualization.


•	Machine Learning Project: : Built a cost-sensitive model classification model using normalized digital behavior data to predict Ulta vs Sephora brand preference, optimizing for ad targeting precision and minimizing false positives

As part of UVA’s Machine Learning capstone, our team was tasked with solving a real business problem using the CRISP-DM framework. The objective was to build a predictive model that could drive smarter business decisions while practicing hands-on data mining and strategic communication. The project required not only technical execution—data prep, modeling, and evaluation—but also the ability to align outcomes with a company’s financial objectives and propose actionable solutions.
We originally proposed building a model for Delta Airlines to predict the virality of tweets using Twitter data from Brandwatch. The goal was to identify negative press before it went viral and optimize crisis response strategies to protect Delta’s brand reputation and revenue. However, due to platform limitations and restricted API access, we were unable to obtain a sufficient dataset to support our modeling pipeline. This setback forced our team to pivot quickly and refocus our project on a more accessible dataset with similar classification objectives.
We turned to a rich dataset of over 46,000 online users with web behavior and demographic data related to Ulta and Sephora. Our new goal was to help Ulta reduce wasted digital advertising by predicting which users were more likely to prefer their brand over Sephora. We engineered features from normalized browsing patterns, applied cost-sensitive learning, and built multiple supervised models including Random Forest and K-NN. The model was evaluated against a real-world cost matrix, prioritizing high precision to avoid wasted spend on Sephora loyalists while still capturing Ulta converts.
Our final model demonstrated strong business impact, with a projected 9% reduction in advertising costs—translating to $5.5 million in annual savings. We presented our work to a panel of faculty and peers, providing strategic recommendations for implementing machine learning into Ulta’s broader marketing infrastructure. This experience sharpened my technical modeling skills, adaptability under constraint, and ability to translate data into business action
